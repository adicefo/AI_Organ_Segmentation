# AI_Organ_Segmentation

<b>Segmentation</b> is a fundamental task in the analysis of medical images, which includes the identification and delineation of regions of interest (ROI) on different medical images, such as organs, lesions and tissues. Accurate segmentation is essential for many clinical applications, including disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease progression monitoring.

<b>Manual segmentation</b> has long been the gold standard for delineating anatomical structures and pathological regions, but this process is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often requires a high degree of expertise.
<hr>
<b>Semi- or fully automatic segmentation</b> methods can significantly reduce the time and labor required, increase consistency, and enable the analysis of large dataset. The advantages of automatic organ segmentation methods compared to traditional methods are that they are capable of learning from large dataset.

In this project CT scan input  has been segmented  into 105 channels which represent whole-body segments using <a href="https://monai.io/model-zoo.html">Monai Model Zoo</a>.
